This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
#run this command in terminal
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Files in `pages/api` are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
